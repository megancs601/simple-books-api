# DO NOT DELETE THIS BRANCH

- To future me, do not delete this branch as this branch is used on alwaysdata to host the backend for [simple-book-api](https://github.com/megancs601/simple-book-api)
- alwaysdata did not like npm installing front-end packages (i.e tailwind and vue) as they were too big. To circumvent the issue, I created this branch to have the bare minimum package in order to run the back-end on alwaysdata
